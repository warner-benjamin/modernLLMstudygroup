This week we will read and discuss 
[*DoReMi: Optimizing Data Mixtures Speeds Up Language Model Pretraining*](<https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10429>). Which first trains a small proxy model using group distributionally robust optimization (Group DRO) over domains to produce domain weights (mixture proportions) without knowledge of downstream tasks. Then resample a dataset with these domain weights and train a larger, full-sized model.
